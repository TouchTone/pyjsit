Python API for writing script for justseed.it seedbox-y service.

This is a first version of a pythonic API to access justseed.it (called JSIT
from now on). Take a look at example_jsit.py to get an idea of how to use it.

The main idea is to make it easy to write scripts that access/use JSIT, to
simply the different workflosws that people use. See the smaller exampels to
get some ideas, new ideas welcome.

This is a very rough first version, and there will be bugs. If you find one
please open an issue at https://github.com/TouchTone/pyjsit/issues and I will
try to take care of it as soon as I can.

Enjoy!
